# Hill-Valley-Prediction
Hill and Valley Prediction using Logistic Regression is to accurately classify whether a given data point or terrain location belongs to a "hill" or a "valley" based on a set of input features.
The objective is to build an efficient and interpretable model that can reliably predict the class (hill or valley) of data points based on their features, supporting decision-making processes in various applications.
